# Machine-Failure-Prediction
## Problem definition:
I am solving a problem of predicting the failure of a water pump which causes a water supply disconnection. There is a water supply system to provide water to a big town and located far from that town. I have an observation of 5 months in which the water pump get failed 7 times. Those failures cause a huge problem for many people and also lead to some serious living problems for some families.
Some people are taking care of that water pump, they tried to analyze all the readings taken from the sensors mounted on a water pump but they failed to make sense out of it to predict the next failure. Hence they proposed this problem to solve by Machine Learning. We have to train a model on the given data and give warning of failure as soon as possible to the person who is taking care of that water pump so that he can take the required step.
It is a binary classification problem where we have to predict the state of the water pump, is it working normally or it is broken.

This problem is posted on Kaggle which is the worldâ€™s largest data science community by an unknown source. You can download data from here.

There are 4 jupyter notebook.
1. best_FE_model.ipynb : You have to check this notebook 1st to understand EDA.
2. tried_failed_FE_Model.ipynb : All the experiments I did to get the result, that is written here.
3. best_FE_model.ipybn : Here is the method stored which gives me the best result.
4. _final.ipynb : This notebook contains how our model is giving output in inference time.
